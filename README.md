## Questions and Answers:
<p align="left">
Q: Why "client"?<br>
A: It has client-like features that would require many mods (.jar files) to "install" one by one.<br>
Q: Why utilize Meteor code and not make yourself original client?<br>
A: Meteor itself is highly advanced, hence you can edit and make amazing stuff out of it.. though I am migrating the functionality of it to my own, therefore importantly, I came up with fair play version.<br>
<br>
Q: Are there any hidden unfair advantage modules?<br>
A: No, all unfair advantage modules have been removed. The client is now 100% fair play compliant.<br>
<br>
Q: Any plans for different UI? Like the ones in NoRisk, Lunar or CheatBreaker?<br>
A: Yes, but here's a catch: It is hard to implement it because current Meteor UI is already great and flexible for future ideas.
